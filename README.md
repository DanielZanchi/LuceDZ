Often the SA needs to add the same bag more than once to the same order (customers often buy multiple items of the same SKU), it's quicker to select the number of items for the same SKU with a vertical picker. 

Sometimes it happens that one SA adds one item for another SA. By default the SA will see his name selected, but with the vertical picker he could select another SA, in order to assign that item to one of his colleagues.

It's easier to input the number of order (fiches) with a "number pad" keyboard.
